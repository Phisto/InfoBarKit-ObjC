# InfoBarKit

The InfoBarKit framework provides an info bar view similar to the info bar in the toolbar of the Xcode project window.


## Requirements

-  macOS 10.10+

  
## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate CoreAudioConverter into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Phisto/InfoBarKit-ObjC" ~> 0.1
```

### Manually as a framework

If you prefer not to use Carthage, you can integrate InfoBarKit into your project manually.
You only need to build and add the InfoBarKit framework (InfoBarKit.framework) to your project. 

### Manually

If you prefer not to use the framework you can copy the SGInfoBar and SGInfoBarTask class in the InfoBarKit/Source folder to your project.
